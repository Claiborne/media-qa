Alberto & Tulasi, here is my high-level overview of load testing Topaz. Please take some time early next week to think about what makes sense, what does not make sense (and where my assumptions are wrong), and provide feedback. Thank you :)

Introduction to Topaz Load Testing
(1) My initial thoughts are that we focus our load testing efforts on services. (This is due to my assumption that the great majority of code written for Topaz is to build these services. Please correct me if I am mistaken.)
(2) The services being load tested will be: Authorization, Authentication, and Entitlements. See Testsuites One & Two
(3) The Oyster code will be load tested by making http GET requests to the relevant URLs

Testsuite One: Popular Use Cases for Services
We will base this testsuite on the predicted most popular flows: logging in, logging out, registering, and password recovery. Alberto and I will briefly sit down to make sure corresponding the endpoints I am using are correct. 
 

REGISTER (Authentication) -- Not? Google, Facebook, Yahoo
http://secure-stg.ign.com/authentication/user/register?oauth_token=12345

LOGIN (Authentication) 
http://secure-stg.ign.com/authentication/login?oauth_token=12345

LOGOUT (Authentication):
http://secure-stg.ign.com/authentication/logout?oauth_token=12345

FORGOT PASSWORD (Authentication too?)
?

QUESTIONS:
Many new users will be created. Purge them?

As for methodology. 

If any load issues are uncovered, we will granulize our scope and uncover the cause.

Testsuite Two: Other Endpoints

Testsuite Three: Oyster Pages
There will be one or two test cases for the Oyster views (registration page, login page, etc)

Load Testing Tool
Jmeter (chosen for its diverseness, extensive reporting features, ease-of-use, and QA's high level of familiarity with it)

Risks and Precautions  
(1) Tech Ops has requested QA notify them any time we do load testing, as per their advice there is often hidden overlap between staging and production hardware dependencies. For this reason we will coordinate with them the time and day load tests are to be run.
(2) In the past, staging hardware for other projects have failed before the load gets the chance to ramp up enough to truly test the code. I know we don't have a lot of control over our hardware, but this is something to keep in mind.
(3) Also be aware that the more our staging environment mirrors production, the more confidence we will have in our results
